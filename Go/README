Don't forget to set the environment variable GOPATH=mmdevel/Go
(where 'mmdevel' is the real path to your mmdevel directory)

For example, to build prmtop_to_binary, which is probably what you want:

export GOROOT=/path/to/go # This and the next command only needed
export PATH=$GOROOT/bin
export GOPATH=mmdevel/Go
go build prmtop_to_binary.go
