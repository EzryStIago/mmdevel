Don't forget to set the environment variable GOPATH=mmdevel/Go
(where 'mmdevel' is the real path to your mmdevel directory)

For example, to build prmtop_to_binary, which is probably what you want:

# Make sure the installation of Go knows where it's located and is in our PATH
export GOROOT=/path/to/go 
export PATH=$GOROOT/bin

# Specify the current Go project (make sure to specify the actual correct directory)
export GOPATH=mmdevel/Go

# Actually do the build, creating an executable called prmtop_to_binary
go build prmtop_to_binary.go
