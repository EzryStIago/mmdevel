Don't forget to set the environment variable GOPATH=mmdevel/Go
(where 'mmdevel' is the real path to your mmdevel directory)

# Specify the current Go project (make sure to specify the actual correct directory)
export GOPATH=mmdevel/Go

# Run the only program you probably actually want
go run prmtop_to_binary.go
